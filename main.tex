\section{Introduction}

In the 1970s with the advent of the personal computer we entered into the Digital or Information Age. However it has only been in this century with the ubiquity of the internet, the smartphone, cloud, and the internet of things that digital has become truly pervasive. How do universities respond to this massive change? Informatics Europe established in 2018 a new working group to investigate what universities are doing to ensure that non-informatics teaching and research is informed by best practice in Informatics.

To better understand the state of affairs on this topic and discover best practices at European Universities, the working group conducted an online survey. We invited heads and members of Informatics/Computer Science/IT Departments (Schools, Faculties, Institutes) to complete a questionnaire in autumn 2018. The request to fill out our survey was sent to all Informatics Europe members and it was also publicly available from the Informatics Europe website.  For the location of the respondents see Figure~\ref{fig:mapandmembers}.  Forty eight universities from nineteen countries filled it out (see Appendix~\ref{apx:names}).

Our survey was wide ranging. We wanted to understand how universities valued interdisciplinary research, about teaching Informatics to non-specialist students, what happens in practice with hiring and supporting interdisciplinary academics, and what structures are in place to support interdisciplinary work. We chose to examine Data Science's impact in detail, given its importance and newness. For the actual survey questions see Appendix~\ref{apx:survey}. 

Although how Informatics (also called Computer Science or Computing) should position itself in a university is a political decision, in many universities what happens has arisen organically rather than strategically. There are a wide range of models with the extremes ranging from primarily being a service department to being primarily a research area that is isolated from other departments.
