\section{Survey: The Wide Role of Informatics at Universities}\label{appendix}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Research
\begin{enumerate}
\item When compared with single disciplinary research, does your
university encourage or discourage (or neither) interdisciplinary
research? If so how? (e.g. funding, time, physical centres)
Encourage
Discourage
Neither encourage nor discourage
\item Does your Informatics department encourage or discourage (or
neither) interdisciplinary research? If so how?
Encourage
Discourage
Neither encourage nor discourage
\item Are there interdisciplinary areas of research where your university
could (should) enter but aren?t due to lack of university support? If so
what are they?
\item Are there other players who have helped increase the
interdisciplinary research in your university?
For example has a funding body focused a programme on
interdisciplinary PhD studentships which academics applied for?If so
what external organisations and what programmes have increased
interdisciplinary research at your university?
\item Please comment on any advantages or disadvantages you perceive
of your university?s arrangements.
\end{enumerate}
\item Teaching
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does your university run joint degrees (e.g. X and Informatics, Informatics and X, X with Informatics, Informatics with X). If yes,
what are they?
Yes
No
\item Are there plans to run new joint degrees or to close down joint
degrees? If yes what are they?
Run new joint degrees
Close down joint degrees
Neither run nor close down
\item Who teaches the Informatics component of non-Informatics degrees? For example, is programming taught to Physicists by members
of the Physics department, of the Informatics department or is there a
servicing organisation within your university that teaches Physics
students to code (or some other mechanism)?
\item If Informatics is taught by people not located in an Informatics
 department are they Computer Scientists by training or research?
They are Computer Scientists
They are not Computer Scientists
Informatics is not taught by people not located in an Informatics department
\item Please comment on any advantages or disadvantages you perceive of your university?s arrangements.
\end{enumerate}
\item People
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does your university explicitly advertise/hire academics who focus
on interdisciplinary research?
Yes
No
\item  Are they rooted in a department, have a joint appointment across
departments, or rooted in a centre?
Rooted in a department
Have a joint appointment across departments
Rooted in a centre
\item How is their quality judged for both appointment and for promotion?For example are they judged according to the criteria of one
of the departments or both? Are the people who judge from a single
department or both?
\item Are there any initiatives planned to hire in interdisciplinary areas?
Yes
No
\item Please comment on any advantages or disadvantages you perceive of your university?s arrangements.
\end{enumerate}
\item Data Science
\begin{enumerate}
\item Which department in your university is seen to own this area? Is it
Informatics, Statistics, jointly or somewhere else?
Informatics Department
Statistics Department
Jointly Informatics and Statistics Department
Somewhere else (please specify)
\item Has the rise of this area changed the perception of Informatics
overall in your university?
Yes
No
\item Please comment on any advantages or disadvantages you perceive of
your university?s arrangements.
\end{enumerate}
\item Structure
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does your university set up centres for interdisciplinary work? If
yes can you say which they are?
Yes
No
\item Are they for research, translation (technology transfer),
consultancy, and/or teaching?
Research
Translation (technology transfer)
Consultancy
Teaching
\item Are they rooted in a single department (say which one), owned by
the departments involved or independent?
Rooted in a single department
Owned by the departments involved
Independent
\item Are they physically located within a department, nearby or
elsewhere on campus?
Within a department
Nearby a department
Elsewhere on campus
\item How are any centres funded? Does the university provide any
money to startup or are they funded by external money? Does the
university provide longer term money?
\item Are there plans to set up more centres or to close centres? If so
what will they be?
Set up more centres
Close centres
Neither set up nor close
\item What are the drivers or pressures (both internal to the department/
school/faculty/university and external to the university)
that you see on the horizon that may lead to new activity?
\item Is substantial interdisciplinary work undertaken by academics
without any institutional or department support?
Without any institutional or department support
With an institutional or department support
\item Are there any centres for interdisciplinary work that have been set
up due to a strategic decision by the university or
department/school/faculty rather than as supporting activities of
existing faculty? If so which centres?
\item Does your university have something in their official strategy to
widen the role of Informatics or to encourage interdisciplinary
research? If so what is it?
\item Please comment on any advantages or disadvantages you perceive of your university?s arrangements.
\item Is there anything we have missed in the survey that you wish to tell us?
